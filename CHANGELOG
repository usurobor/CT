**Status:** Hardened Verification & Onboarding  

### Highlights  
- Added **Verification Sampling Policy** \(π_verify\) for adversarial verification.  
- Introduced **J_cost** = information + verification cost.  
- Added **HANDSHAKE** state for new-agent onboarding.  
- Secured distributed trust initialization (α_i = 0).  
- Expanded “Simplify” actions to cover verification cost.

---

## [v1.2.7] – 2025-10-15  
**Status:** Full Control Formalization  

### Highlights  
- Introduced **LOCKDOWN** state for OOD isolation.  
- Fixed threshold at 0.80 (removed adaptive θ_t).  
- Added **τ-budget** as a managed controller resource.  
- Unified sensitivity tuning under meta-controller \(R_meta\).  
- Linked distributed agents axiomatically to core composition law.

---

## [v1.2.6] – 2025-10-10  
**Status:** Meta-Stability & Distributed Dynamics  

### Highlights

**Status:** Adaptive Dynamics & Minimal-Information Control  

### Highlights  
- Made `REINFLATE` objective adaptive with dynamic witness weights.  
- Introduced uncertainty-gated cadence \(K\).  
- Replaced “H-first fallback” with `STATE_MINIMAL_INFO`.  
- Clarified meta-controller as preconditioner for Φ_info optimization.  

---

## [v1.2.4] – 2025-10-02  
**Status:** Info-Theoretic Control & Isometry  

### Highlights  
- Upgraded Lyapunov candidate to information-theoretic Φ_info.  
- Added gauge-isometry objective to R_meta.  
- Introduced formal `STATE_REINFLATE` safe mode.  
- Hardened D_c metric against collapse via entropy/variance floors.  

---

**Status:** Hardened Witnesses & Meta-Gauging  

### Highlights  
- Added entropy floor H_min to prevent multimodal collapse.  
- Introduced meta-optimization for gauge sharpness.  
- Added trust-weighted consensus for multi-agent coherence.  

---

## [v1.2.2] – 2025-09-26  
**Status:** Gauge & Risk-Aware Addendum  

### Highlights  
- Added gauge normalization and variance witness.  
- Introduced CI-based verification and risk-aware thresholds.  
- Added Lyapunov formulation for controller convergence.  

---

## [v1.1.17] – 2025-09-20  
**Status:** Immutable Core Foundation  

### Highlights  
- Defined Triadic Axioms (A1–A4).  
- Established coherence metrics \(H_c, V_c, D_c, C_\Sigma\).  
- Proved contraction of controller \(R\) and final coalgebra uniqueness.
