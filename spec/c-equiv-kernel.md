# C≡ Kernel — Foundational Bootstrap & Working Notes

**Version:** 2.0.0 (corresponds to TSC v2.2.2)  
**Status:** Kernel (normative bootstrap) + Annex (informative-but-binding)  
**Dependency:** Informal bridge to C≡ v2.2.2, Core v2.2.2, Operational v2.2.2

## Part I: Kernel (One-Page Bootstrap)

C≡ is a minimal language for recognizing **cohering**. It says only this:

> There is **one ongoing happening** (the symbol "≡" points to it).  
> Everything we say about it are **labels of the same thing**.

This Kernel is the historical bootstrap that led to TSC Core and Operational.  
It is short on purpose: humans can read this and *use* the system.

### 1) The Primitive

- **Symbol:** `≡` means *cohering* — the holding‑together that keeps happening.

- **Triadic articulation:** the same `≡` is *co‑labeled* three ways during measurement:
  - **α** — pattern stability (what holds)
  - **β** — relational coherence (how parts fit)
  - **γ** — process stability (how it unfolds)

These are **labels of one happening**, not three separate spaces. Your verifier later checks whether the three descriptions fit one thing. (Core keeps the math; Operational runs the protocol.)

### 2) Two Rules (The Whole Logic)

- **Tripling (normalization):**  
  Saying "cohering cohering cohering" is still just "cohering."  
  (We never get paradox by iterating "≡"; self‑application stabilizes.)

- **Role symmetry (S₃‑symmetry):**  
  If you permute the labels α/β/γ, the *situation* stays the same.  
  (Our math and decisions must not depend on which label we used.)

### 3) What We Actually Measure

1. **Make observations** in each axis (α,β,γ) → **summaries** (geometry + distributions).
2. **Compare** summaries pairwise by **alignments** (an ensemble of correspondence solvers).  
   The comparison returns a **coherence score** in [0,1].
3. Reduce to three dimension scores and an aggregate:
   - **α_c** — stability of α across repeats
   - **β_c** — cross-axis fit from the pairwise ensemble
   - **γ_c** — dynamical stability
   - **C_Σ = (α_c · β_c · γ_c)^(1/3)** — overall coherence (with CI)

4. **Verdict & governance:** confidence intervals, witness floors (variance/entropy/Lipschitz), and OOD gate drive PASS/FAIL and controller state.

> The Core file defines these objects and formulas; Operational turns them into a repeatable protocol with verdicts, witnesses, and controller states.

### 4) Why This Matters (And Composes)

- **Reality‑agnostic:** We don't posit inner images or hidden spaces. We compare **articulations** of one happening.
- **Reproducible:** Runs ship a provenance bundle so anyone can recompute α_c, β_c, γ_c, C_Σ.
- **Compositional:** Coherent pieces tend to stay coherent when combined (log‑concave behavior under aligned product).

### 5) What This Kernel Is **Not**

- Not a claim about "three ontological substances."
- Not a map between "spaces."
- Not a theory of mind or physics.

It's a **way to tell whether our three descriptions fit one happening**—and to do so auditably.

## Part II: Annex (Working Notes for Core/Operational)

**Status:** Informative‑but‑binding where referenced by Core/Operational

This Annex gives the *minimal* formal detail that Core/Operational rely on:  
how "co‑labels of one happening" are compared **without** reintroducing representations.

### A. Terms (Just Enough Algebra)

- **Happening:** `≡` (cohering).

- **Articulation operators:** for each axis $a\in\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma\}$, an **articulation** produces observations $O_a = A_a(≡) \subseteq \Omega_a$ ("observe in context Ω_a"). Core §0 defines these formally.

- **Summary:** $S_a = (d_a, p_a, \mathcal{H}_a, \mathcal{I}_a)$ — geometry, distributions, entropy, invariants. See Core §0 for full specification.

- **Alignment (correspondence):** a solver returns a mapping $\sigma$ between $O_a$ and $O_b$ that lets us compute a **discrepancy** $\Delta$ between $S_a$ and $S_b$. We use an **ensemble** $\mathcal{A}_{ab}$ (≥3 solvers) to estimate mean and variance. See Core §2.2 for ensemble protocol.

- **Coherence predicate:** $Coh = \exp(-\lambda\,\Delta) \in [0,1]$.

> **No "translation between spaces."** $\sigma$ is a comparison device for measurement, not an ontological bridge.

### B. The Three Scores and the Aggregate (Core Handshake)

- **α_c** — within‑axis stability (repeat the α articulation and compare). See Core §3.1.
- **β_c** — geometric mean of pairwise ensemble coherences across (α,β), (β,γ), (γ,α). See Core §3.3.
- **γ_c** — dynamical stability (e.g., Wasserstein between successive summary distributions). See Core §3.2.
- **Aggregate:** $C_Σ = (α_c \cdot β_c \cdot γ_c)^{1/3}$ with **95% CI**. See Core §4.

- **Witnesses & OOD:** ensemble variance must be under floor; entropy/Lipschitz/sample floors apply; track stability statistic $Z_t$ vs $Z_{crit}$. Operational governs PASS/FAIL/DEGENERATE and controller transitions.

### C. Ensemble Discipline (Why Comparers, Not Bijections)

- Replace old "$\sigma$‑bijections" with **alignment solvers** (e.g., entropic OT) chosen before observation; log the configuration ($\varepsilon$, costs, priors, seeds, iteration caps). This is what Operational calls the **ensemble**.

- **Stability witness:** report $\overline{Coh}_{ab}$ and $Var(Coh_{ab})$. If variance exceeds floor, the run is **invalid regardless of C_Σ**.

- **Why this avoids representationalism:** we never claim a truth‑preserving map between separate domains—only that two articulations can be *compared* with bounded distortion.

### D. Composition (Why Modules Don't Explode)

Core's "aligned product" ensures **log‑concave** behavior of $C_Σ$: coherent modules tend to remain coherent when coupled under a declared alignment (with small coupling penalty $\varepsilon_{comp}$). This stabilizes hierarchical build‑ups. See Core §7.

### E. Controller Semantics (Operational Handshake)

Operational runs a small state machine—OPTIMIZE, REINFLATE, MINIMAL_INFO, LOCKDOWN, HANDSHAKE—to keep ensembles/budgets stable while respecting the same witnesses and CI/OOD gate. Math stays unchanged; policy adapts **how** we sample/align. See Operational §5.

### F. What to Log (Provenance Bundle)

- Context contracts, seeds, sampler indices
- Summary schemas/hashes; solver configs ($\varepsilon$, costs, priors, iters)
- Ensemble statistics: $\overline{Coh}_{ab}$, variance; witnesses; α_c, β_c, γ_c, C_Σ with CI
- **Unit types:** When composing processes ($x \odot_a y$), log which axis $a \in \{\alpha,\beta,\gamma\}$ was used, enabling audit of typed unit usage ($1_\alpha, 1_\beta, 1_\gamma$). See C≡ v2.2.2 §1.3.

This is sufficient for third parties to recompute the verdict. See Operational §7 for full provenance requirements.

### G. Scope Boundary (Why This Stays Small)

C≡ asserts *labels of one happening*, not inner images. Core is a **measurement calculus**; Operational is **policy**. That's the whole stack.
