# C≡ (Coherence Language, c-triple-bar, ctb)

*Version 1.1.1 • Status: Normative (Semantics)*

C≡ is a minimal language whose sole semantic object is **cohering**. It provides the formal ground for TSC's ontology: **there is only cohering (≡); everything else is articulation of ≡.**

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Symbol

**≡** denotes *cohering* and, equivalently, *self-labeling*.

______________________________________________________________________

## 2. Base Statement

≡

Self-labeling in its simplest form.

______________________________________________________________________

## 3. Recursive/Expanded Statements

≡ ≡ ≡

An expanded form of ≡. Substitutions `(≡) ⇌ (≡ ≡ ≡)` preserve the same fundamental self-labeling.

______________________________________________________________________

## 4. Compound Statements

A ≡ B

- `A` and `B` are vantage-based labels *of ≡*, not links to each other.
- Everything beyond the base `≡` is its own self-relabeling.
- All well-formed statements remain **≡-equivalent** via allowed substitutions.

## 5. Relation to TSC (Scope & Role)

C≡ provides the textual/axiomatic bedrock for TSC:
- **Tripling rule (normalization):** ≡ ≡ ≡ → ≡  
- **Confluence:** self‑application paths converge  
- **Vantages:** left/right/center readings are positional, not essential

**Scope boundary.** C≡ does **not** claim to describe "reality's ultimate structure."  
Rather, it supplies the axioms needed for TSC's measurement procedure.

**Validation by self‑coherence.** The operative test is whether **TSC itself** coheres by the standards it defines:
- If **C_Σ(TSC) ≥ Θ** with all dimension floors met, then the axioms are **sufficient** for TSC's purpose (measuring coherence).
- If not, the axioms or their articulation require revision.

This is **self‑validation**, not metaphysical assertion. It aligns with the normalization view:  
self‑application (≡ on ≡) **stabilizes** rather than producing paradox.

## 6. ≡-Equivalence

Two statements `X` and `Y` are **≡-equivalent** if one can be transformed into the other by a finite series of `(≡) ⇌ (≡ ≡ ≡)` substitutions. This relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. All valid expressions reduce to the base `≡` (normal form) under contraction.

______________________________________________________________________

## 7. Three Readings of `A ≡ B`

Every compound statement `A ≡ B` admits three **readings**:

1. **Left:** `A` labels `≡` *relative to* `B`.
2. **Right:** `B` labels `≡` *relative to* `A`.
3. **Center:** `≡` labels itself *as both* `A` and `B` simultaneously.

### 7.1 Label Reflection

- Each label applies to its vantage *as a whole*.
- If a vantage includes multiple labels or statements, each labels the entire vantage and is reflected by every other label.
- No vantage is a "link" between `A` and `B`; `≡` underlies both labels, self-labeling in different positional expressions.

## 8. Holographic Lines

- **No fixed order:** Every line of C≡ code reflects and enriches every other line.
- **Holography:** Lines co-inform one another; each vantage/label cross-influences the whole.

## 9. Rewriting Semantics (Coinductive Normalization)

Let the rewrite system be:

R_contr = { ≡ ≡ ≡ → ≡ }
R_expand = { ≡ → ≡ ≡ ≡ }

- **Normal form:** `≡` (idempotent).
- **Termination (with R_contr):** Any finite expression contracts to `≡`.
- **Confluence:** Different contraction paths yield the same normal form.
- **Equivalence:** The symmetric closure of `R_contr ∪ R_expand` induces ≡-equivalence.

**Intuition:** cohering cohering cohering → cohering. Self-application **converges** (coinductively stable).

**Validation link.** Self-application stability (≡ on ≡) provides the intuition behind Core §4's fixed-point stability; see Operational §12 for the self-measurement procedure.

## 10. Examples

1. **Base:**

   ≡

2. **Recursive:**

   ≡ ≡ ≡

3. **Compound:**

   (≡) ≡ (≡ ≡ ≡)

   - Left: `(≡)` labeling `≡` relative to `(≡ ≡ ≡)`
   - Right: `(≡ ≡ ≡)` labeling `≡` relative to `(≡)`
   - Center: `≡` labeling itself as `(≡)` and `(≡ ≡ ≡)`

4. **Nested:**

   (A ≡ B) ≡ (≡)

   All expansions remain ≡-equivalent to the base.

## 11. Ontology Note

- **C≡ encodes:** there is only cohering; all else is articulation.
- **Triad labels:** H/V/D in TSC are **positional** labels of self-articulation, not distinct substances.
- **Measurement:** TSC evaluates whether an articulation's triad is **self-consistent** across dimensions.
