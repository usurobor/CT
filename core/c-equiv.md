# C≡ (Coherence Language, c-triple-bar)
*Version 1.0.9 • Status: Normative (Semantics)*

C≡ is a minimal language whose sole semantic object is **cohering**. It provides the formal ground for TSC’s ontology: **there is only cohering (≡); everything else is articulation of ≡.**

---

## 1. Symbol

**≡** denotes *cohering* and, equivalently, *self-labeling*.

---

## 2. Base Statement

≡

Self-labeling in its simplest form.

---

## 3. Recursive/Expanded Statements

≡ ≡ ≡

An expanded form of ≡. Substitutions `(≡) ⇌ (≡ ≡ ≡)` preserve the same fundamental self-labeling.

---

## 4. Compound Statements

A ≡ B

- `A` and `B` are vantage-based labels *of ≡*, not links to each other.  
- Everything beyond the base `≡` is its own self-relabeling.  
- All well-formed statements remain **≡-equivalent** via allowed substitutions.

---

## 5. ≡-Equivalence

Two statements `X` and `Y` are **≡-equivalent** if one can be transformed into the other by a finite series of `(≡) ⇌ (≡ ≡ ≡)` substitutions. This relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. All valid expressions reduce to the base `≡` (normal form) under contraction.

---

## 6. Three Readings of `A ≡ B`

Every compound statement `A ≡ B` admits three **readings**:

1. **Left:** `A` labels `≡` *relative to* `B`.  
2. **Right:** `B` labels `≡` *relative to* `A`.  
3. **Center:** `≡` labels itself *as both* `A` and `B` simultaneously.

### 6.1 Label Reflection
- Each label applies to its vantage *as a whole*.  
- If a vantage includes multiple labels or statements, each labels the entire vantage and is reflected by every other label.  
- No vantage is a “link” between `A` and `B`; `≡` underlies both labels, self-labeling in different positional expressions.

---

## 7. Holographic Lines

- **No fixed order:** Every line of C≡ code reflects and enriches every other line.  
- **Holography:** Lines co-inform one another; each vantage/label cross-influences the whole.

---

## 8. Rewriting Semantics (Coinductive Normalization)

Let the rewrite system be:

R_contr = {  ≡ ≡  →  ≡  }
R_expand = {  ≡    →  ≡ ≡ ≡  }

- **Normal form:** `≡` (idempotent).  
- **Termination (with R_contr):** Any finite expression contracts to `≡`.  
- **Confluence:** Different contraction paths yield the same normal form.  
- **Equivalence:** The symmetric closure of `R_contr ∪ R_expand` induces ≡-equivalence.

Intuition: **cohering cohering cohering → cohering.** Self-application **converges** (coinductively stable).

---

## 9. Examples

1. **Base:**  

≡

2. **Recursive:**  

≡ ≡ ≡

3. **Compound:**  

(≡) ≡ (≡ ≡ ≡)

- Left: `(≡)` labeling `≡` relative to `(≡ ≡ ≡)`  
- Right: `(≡ ≡ ≡)` labeling `≡` relative to `(≡)`  
- Center: `≡` labeling itself as `(≡)` and `(≡ ≡ ≡)`

4. **Nested:**  

(A ≡ B) ≡ (≡)

All expansions remain ≡-equivalent to the base.

---

## 10. Relation to TSC

- **Ontology:** C≡ encodes that there is only cohering; all else is articulation.  
- **Triad labels:** H/V/D are **positional** labels of self-articulation, not distinct substances.  
- **Measurement:** TSC evaluates whether an articulation’s triad is **self-consistent** across dimensions.
