# Random Soup (Negative Control for Coherence)

**Why this exists:** This is the *failure case* to pair with `glider.md` (high coherence, C_Σ ≈ 0.996; PASS).  
Your TSC implementation should report **low coherence** on this file: **C_Σ ≈ 0.25 → FAIL**.

**What it is:** Each time step is an **independent** 16×16 binary grid.  
Cells are drawn i.i.d. from Bernoulli(p=0.5), with `#` = 1 and `.` = 0. Frames are not related to each other, by design.

**How to use:** Run the exact same pipeline you used for `glider.md` on these frames.
You should observe:
- `glider.md` → **high** C_Σ (~0.996), PASS
- `random_soup.md` → **low** C_Σ (~0.25), **FAIL**

If `random_soup.md` scores high, your implementation likely has a leakage/normalization issue
(e.g., measuring within-frame similarity, mixing up time indexing, or averaging the wrong axes).

## Reproducibility

- RNG seed: `1337`  
- Bernoulli p: `0.5`  
- MD5 of concatenated frame characters (including newlines between rows/frames):  
  `363c791829522b3dc2174520bc6e2ac0`

## Troubleshooting checklist

- **High score here?** Check that you are:
  - Comparing **across time** (t vs. t+1), not within-frame.
  - Using the **same preprocessing** as `glider.md` (tokenization, binarization, normalization).
  - Averaging the correct **time axis** and not including t=0 twice.
  - Not accidentally shuffling frames or caching results across examples.
