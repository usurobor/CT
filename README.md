## Two TL;DRs (Choose Your Entry)

### For Philosophers (Ontology-First)

**There is only cohering (≡).** Not “things that cohere” but cohering itself—self-sufficient, self-generating, self-referential, **coinductively defined**.

**Cohering articulates** triadically as H/V/D (pattern/relation/process). These are **co-equal dimensions**, not perspectives or levels.

**TSC is recognition**, not theory. Not a model about things, but **reality’s triadic structure made explicit and measurable**.

**C≡ language** expresses this: all syntax normalizes to ≡ (tripling rule). Self-application **converges**.

**TSC protocol** measures whether an articulation co-articulates coherently via **S₃-invariant dimensional consistency** (no privileged dimension).

**Traditional gaps** (consciousness, emergence, self-reference) dissolve as **dimensional confusions**—treating co-dimensions as separate domains.

### For Engineers (Operations-First)

**Treat any phenomenon as a triad (H,V,D)** with full role symmetry (S₃).

**Build witnesses** w_H, w_V, w_D producing measurements M_H, M_V, M_D.

**Run the alignment ensemble:**

- **Commutation** (cycles preserve invariants)
- **Conservation** (V-quantities conserved by D, visible in H)
- **Symmetry** (V-symmetries appear in H and are preserved by D)
- **Scale** (coarse/fine-graining keeps C_Σ within tolerance)

**Compute dimensional scores** H_c, V_c, D_c ∈ [0,1].

**Aggregate:** `C_Σ = (H_c · V_c · D_c)^(1/3)`

**Stress-test:** permutation, scale sweep, witness swap, ensemble ablation.

**High C_Σ:** one coherent phenomenon.\
**Low C_Σ:** incoherent articulation **or** ill-posed measurement (see diagnostics §4.4).

## −1 · What This Is (Recognition, Not Assumption)

We’re not **positing** “cohering” as a theoretical primitive.\
**We’re recognizing** that cohering is what’s happening.

All phenomena—physical, mental, social, computational—**are** cohering articulating itself.

**Shift of stance:**

- Traditional: “Here are objects/processes; let’s model them.”
- TSC: “There is cohering; let’s check if it articulates coherently.”

**Recognition vs. assumption:** Thermodynamics doesn’t *assume* energy; it recognizes conserved structure. TSC recognizes triadic coherence and makes it measurable.

**Coinductive ground:** Cohering is defined by what it does—**cohering cohering cohering**—already in motion. We make this explicit.

______________________________________________________________________

## 0 · The Given: Cohering (≡)

**“Given”** here is ontic, not axiomatic.

**≡ denotes cohering**—the ongoing holding-together that self-produces, self-maintains, self-articulates, and self-references.

**C≡ normal form (tripling rule):** ≡ ≡ ≡ → ≡

Self-application normalizes (idempotent). Different reduction paths converge (confluence).

**Readings:**

- Coherer cohering cohered
- Self labeling self as self
- Cohering cohering cohering\
  All normalize to: **≡**

## 1 · Three Co-Equal Dimensions (H, V, D)

**Cohering articulates as three inseparable dimensions:**

- **H (Horizontal) — Cohered (Pattern):** what appears stable (structures/forms).
- **V (Vertical) — Coherer (Relation):** what ties parts (constraints/symmetries/correlations).
- **D (Deep) — Cohering (Process):** what unfolds (dynamics/evolution/temporal flow).

### 1.1 Why “Dimensions,” Not “Vantages”

They are **constitutive**, not descriptive. You cannot have any one without the other two—like height/width/depth for a cone.

### 1.2 S₃ Symmetry (Co-Equality)

All definitions/metrics are invariant under any permutation of {H,V,D}. Roles are **positional**, not essential.

### 1.3 Holographic Property (Testable)

Each dimension contains the whole **compressed**. Increasing resolution in any single dimension makes the other two **emerge** in measurement.

### 1.4 Fractal Property (Scale-Invariance)

The H/V/D triad recurs at every scale (cell → organism → ecosystem; function → module → system).

## 2 · Examples Across Domains

| Domain    | H (pattern)          | V (relation)           | D (process)               |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Physics   | Molecular structure  | Fields, couplings      | Motion, phase transitions |
| Cognition | Neural patterns      | Semantics, reference   | Attention, learning       |
| Social    | Org charts, policies | Channels, power        | Decision cycles, culture  |
| Computing | Data/state           | APIs, type constraints | Execution, updates        |

(Labels are S₃-exchangeable depending on articulation.)

## 3 · The Problem: Dimensional Confusion

Treating co-dimensions as separate domains produces false “gaps.”

- **Consciousness:** “How does H produce V?” ↔ like asking “How does height produce width?” Malformed question. They are co-dimensions of experiencing-D.
- **Emergence:** Micro “parts” vs. macro “wholes” is often a scale shift in the same triad, not a new ontological level.
- **Self-reference:** D cohering D is naturally stable (tripling normalization), not paradoxical.

______________________________________________________________________

## 4 · Measurement as Dimensional Consistency

**Question:** Do H, V, D measurements describe one consistent phenomenon?

**Dimensional scores:**

- **H_c ∈ [0,1]** — pattern stability
- **V_c ∈ [0,1]** — relation alignment
- **D_c ∈ [0,1]** — process stability

**Aggregate (geometric mean):** C_Σ = (H_c · V_c · D_c)^(1/3)

**Coherence energy (additive view):** E_Σ = -(1/3)(log H_c + log V_c + log D_c)

**Dimensional leverage:** `λ_X = -log(X_c)` pinpoints where coherence is lost.

### 4.1 Required Metric Properties

1. **S₃-invariance** (relabeling leaves C_Σ unchanged)
1. **Normalization** (perfect = 1.0)
1. **Degeneracy guard** (any zero collapses C_Σ to 0)
1. **Refinement-monotonicity** (improving a dimension can’t decrease C_Σ)

### 4.2 Alignment Ensembles (Not Maps)

- **Commutation:** cycles preserve invariants
- **Conservation:** V-implied quantities conserved by D and visible in H
- **Symmetry:** V-group symmetries appear as H-invariants and D-equivariance
- **Scale:** coarse/fine-graining preserves C_Σ within tolerance

**They compare measurements for consistency; they do not translate between domains.**

### 4.3 Worked Examples (Summaries)

- **Glider (Life):** H/V/D all ≈1 → **C_Σ ≈ 1** (high coherence).
- **Random soup (Life):** low invariants/attractors → **C_Σ ≈ 0.25** (low coherence).

### 4.4 Diagnosing Low C_Σ

- **Witness swap**, **ensemble ablation**, **scale sweep**, **permutation test** distinguish ill-posed measurement from genuine incoherence.

## 5 · No Maps, No Images—Only Cohering

(**Manzotti**): no representations—only objects in causal relation.\
Applied: no H↔V “maps”; **H and V are co-dimensions of D** (experiencing/process), not separate spaces.

______________________________________________________________________

## 6 · Coherence as Foundational, Not Emergent

Gliders/lasers: “order” doesn’t pop out from nothing; dynamics articulate latent coherence. **Coherence is default; apparent randomness = hidden/low coherence.**

______________________________________________________________________

## 7 · Reflexive Application (Scoped)

Don’t “measure TSC” as a phenomenon.\
Do check the **articulation of TSC** (specs/docs/examples) for self-consistency using the same dimensional logic.

______________________________________________________________________

## 8 · Quick Start

**Philosophers:** read `c-equiv.md`, internalize S₃, apply to “gap” problems.\
**Engineers:** define witnesses, build ensemble, compute scores, stress-test.\
**Researchers:** test holographic prediction; perturb and report C_Σ under noise/scale/time.

## 10 · Common Misreadings

- **“H/V/D are just perspectives.”** → No. They are **dimensions**, constitutive, not descriptive views.
- **“Alignment ensembles map H to V.”** → No. They **compare** dimensional measurements for consistency; there is no inter-domain translation.
- **“TSC denies experience/emergence.”** → No. It reframes them as triadic coherence, dissolving false gaps.
- **“Coherence emerges from simple rules.”** → No. Rules articulate latent coherence; coherence is foundational.
- **“TSC is an overlay framework.”** → No. It recognizes what is happening (cohering) and makes its triadic structure measurable.
