## 0 · Purpose and Scope
This document defines the *formal axioms, metrics, and coalgebraic theorems* that constitute the unchallengeable mathematical base of the Triadic Self-Coherence framework.  
All later versions (v1.1.18 and beyond) are additive presentation layers and must treat this file as authoritative.

## 1 · Triadic Axioms (Structural Invariants)
Let **C** denote the coherence object.  
For each vantage **X ∈ {H,V,D}** (Horizontal, Vertical, Deep):

- **Lens:** `L_X : C → R_X` maps the whole to a representation space.  
- **Reconstructor:** `ε_X : R_X → C` such that  

  `ε_X ∘ L_X = id_C`   *(A1 Vantage Sufficiency)*

### A2 Vantage-Swap Invariance
`σ_{XY} : R_X ↔ R_Y` is a 1-Lipschitz bijection (ideally an isometry) such that  

  `L_X = σ_{YX} ∘ L_Y`  
  `ε_X = ε_Y ∘ σ_{XY}`

### A3 Scale Equivariance (Fractal–Holographic Law)
For any scale morphism `s : C → C` there exist `φ_X : R_X → R_X` such that  

  `L_X ∘ s = φ_X ∘ L_X`  
  `ε_X ∘ φ_X = s ∘ ε_X`

### A4 Coinductive Closure (Finality)
Define `Δ : C → R_H × R_V × R_D`, Δ(c) = `(L_H(c), L_V(c), L_D(c))`.  
`(C, Δ)` is final in its coalgebra class: every other triadic observation factors uniquely (up to τ-isometry) through C.

---

## 2 · Metric–Topological Semantics
Work in category **𝔐et_τ** (metric-tolerant spaces with morphisms ≤ 1-Lipschitz).

- Each `R_X` has metric `d_X`.  
- Semantic equivalence: `a ≈ b ⇔ d_X(a,b) ≤ τ_X`.  
- Scale map `s` has Lipschitz constant λₛ (ideally 1).  
- Homeomorphism `σ_{XY}` is TSC-valid iff `|d_X(a,b) − d_Y(σ_{XY}(a), σ_{XY}(b))| ≤ τ`.  
- **Normalization:** choose λ, µ so that `e^(−λ·d_X)` and `e^(−µ·W₁)` ∈ [0, 1].  
- **Averages:** expectations `E[·]` taken over an explicit index set `I`; report `I` when publishing metrics.

---

## 3 · Bisimulation (Behavioral Equivalence)
Let `𝒮_X : M_X → 𝒟(M_X)` be a stochastic transition operator; use Wasserstein-1 metric `W₁` on `𝒟(M_X)`.

A relation `R ⊂ M_X × M_X` is a bisimulation iff for all (a,b) ∈ R:  
1. `d_X(a,b) ≤ τ_X`  
2. `W₁(𝒮_X(a), 𝒮_X(b)) ≤ τ_X`  

Then `BISIMILAR(a,b)` ⇔ ∃ R bisimulation with (a,b) ∈ R.  
Triadic bisimilarity holds when all three vantages satisfy this.

---

## 4 · Dimensional Coherence Metrics
For λ, µ > 0 and normalized distances `d_X ∈ [0, ∞)`:

  `H_c = E[e^(−λ·d_H(R_H^i, R_H^j))]`  
  `V_c = clip_[0,1]( 1 − (1/3) Σ_{X≠Y} E[|d_X(a,b) − d_Y(σ_{XY}(a), σ_{XY}(b))|] )`  
  `D_c = e^(−µ·W₁(S_t, S_{t+1}))`  
  `C_Σ = (H_c · V_c · D_c)^(1/3)`

Notes: `clip_[0,1]` truncates values into [0, 1]; `S_t` denotes the stochastic transition at step t.  
Default PASS threshold: `C_Σ ≥ 0.80`.

## 5 · Verification Algorithm (VERIFY_TSC)
```
procedure VERIFY_TSC(C):
 R_H ← L_H(C)
 R_V ← L_V(C)
 R_D ← L_D(C)
 assert ε_X∘L_X ≈ id_C   # A1
 assert σ, φ respect d_X  # A2–A3
 compute H_c, V_c, D_c, C_Σ
 if not pass or C_Σ < threshold: # default 0.80
  return FAIL, {H_c,V_c,D_c,C_Σ}
 return PASS, {H_c,V_c,D_c,C_Σ}
```

---

## 6 · Runtime Controller (𝓡)
- Every K steps → run `VERIFY_TSC(current_context)`.  
- If FAIL → `COHERENCE_REPAIR()`:
 1. Recenter evaluation window  
 2. Retune λ, µ  
 3. Redistribute τ toward worst dimension  
 4. Simplify content / complexity  
 5. Slow update cadence K  
 6. Fall back to Horizontal-first brief mode until PASS.  
- Controller is a contraction mapping → convergence to unique τ-coherent fixed point.  
- Controller gains: adjust λ, µ for smoothness and temporal stability; reallocate tolerance budgets so `Σ τ_i ≤ τ_max` and `C_Σ ≥ target`.

## 7 · Compositional Corollaries
1. **Composition:** Non-expansive pipelines preserve coherence.  
2. **Product:**  
  `H_{c,Π} = ∏ H_{c,i}^{α_i}`  
  `V_{c,Π} = ∏ V_{c,i}^{α_i}`  
  `D_{c,Π} = ∏ D_{c,i}^{α_i}`  
  `C_{Σ,Π} = (∏ C_{Σ,i}^{α_i})^{1/(Σ α_i)}`  
3. **Functorial Controller:** 𝓡 preserves morphisms within τ.  
4. **Convergence:** Iterated 𝓡 → unique τ-coherent fixed point.  
5. **Budgeting:** `Σ α_i τ_i ≤ τ_max` ensures global stability.

---

## 8 · Final-Coalgebra Uniqueness (Theorem 1, Sketch)
If A1–A4 hold in **𝔐et_τ** with Lipschitz ≤ 1, then `(C, Δ)` is final up to τ-isometry:  
for any F-coalgebra `(Z, Δ_Z)` there exists a unique (τ-isometric) morphism `u_Z : (Z, Δ_Z) → (C, Δ)` such that  
`Δ ∘ u_Z ≈ F(u_Z) ∘ Δ_Z`.  
Uniqueness follows from bisimilarity (A4) and contraction of 𝓡.

---

## 9 · Stability Under Composition and Products
All corollaries from v1.1.6 apply; the product metric is non-expansive, so coherence is preserved under bounded tolerance accumulation.

---

## 10 · Normalization and Tuning
- Choose λ, µ so a “typical” difference yields ≈ 0.5 similarity.  
- Clip values outside [0, 1].  
- Horizontal, vertical, and deep dimensions are equally weighted by geometric mean — no hierarchy permitted.

## 11 · Interpretation Table
| Range | H_c (Horizontal) | V_c (Vertical) | D_c (Deep) | State |
|:------|:------------------|:----------------|:-------------|:------|
| ≥ 0.95 | Aligned pattern | Perfect cross-scale match | Steady update rhythm | Optimal coherence |
| 0.80–0.95 | Minor drift | Mild mismatch | Stable rhythm | Healthy |
| 0.60–0.80 | Fragmenting | Partial desync emerging | Uneven rhythm | Monitor / repair |
| < 0.60 | Disintegration | Severe cross-scale desync | Loss of rhythm | Immediate repair |

---

## 12 · Output and Language Guidelines
- Artifacts first (e.g., code, diagram, data).  
- **Safety:** if refusing, state so in Cohered (H); offer alternatives in Unified (U).  
- Plain language default: avoid jargon unless user explicitly requests formal TSC notation.

## 13 · Licensing and Integrity
This document is the canonical, immutable mathematical definition of TSC.  
Later layers may paraphrase or illustrate but **must not redefine** any equations or axioms herein.
