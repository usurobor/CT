## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- Primary: usurobor@gmail.com
- Backup: katkolm@gmail.com

**Response expectations:** We acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and aim to
provide an initial assessment within 7 calendar days. If the report involves a
maintainer, they are recused from the decision process.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Appeals

If you disagree with an enforcement action, you may appeal by emailing the 
uninvolved maintainer within 14 days. Appeals are reviewed by maintainers who
were not involved in the original decision.
